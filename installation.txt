In development environment, to distinguish how we start the app from the production environment, we need to set an
environment variable which tell Django to use a different configuration. For this reason, before starting the server,
we need to define a variable that tell Django that we are in a development environment.

`export DJANGO_DEVELOPMENT=true`

Finally, start the server:

`python manage.py runserver`

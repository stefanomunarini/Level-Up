Until 1946 the trams had to change direction at St. Olavs Gate, but that year a loop was built at the station so the trams could continue on without changing direction. Until 1966, passengers were not allowed on or off along the tram line they shared with the city owned Trondheim Sporvei. The operation of the tram was taken over by Trondheim Trafikkselskap in 1974. From 1973 the line continued on to Voldsminde and later in the 1980s to Lade, and didn't stop at St. Olavs Gate. After Gr\u00e5kallbanen was reopened in 1990, St. Olavs Gate station again became the terminus for the line.[3]",

    "description": "Stefano Pesori (fl.1648 in Mantua \u2013 1675) was a 17th-century Italian 5-course Baroque guitarist, composer, and teacher.\r\n\r\nPesori was a renowned guitarist in his time, and had upwards of 140 students, including high-ranking nobility.[1] He is not well known today. He worked as a composer, teacher, and performer in the 17th century, using both written notation and Alfabeto \u2013 the precursor to modern \u201clead-sheet\u201dsystems \u2013 that associated letters with certain harmonies.\r\n\r\nStefano Pesori published five books in his lifetime. Graham Wade remarks that they, \u201cemploy[ed] both strummed and plucked styles, including battute accompaniments to songs and dances\u201d .[2] Many of these books heavily borrow material from one another, as shown by evidence that he used identical engraving plates for multiple sections of many of his works.[3] The books contain lists of his students, often arranged according to their social status.[4] His prototypical student would have been novices \u2013 as evidenced by the book's largely simplistic music. These encompass music in lower positions of the instrument that avoided complex textures, rhythms, and techniques.[5] Some of his more famous contemporaries \u2013 such as Giovanni Paolo Foscarini (fl. 1600\u20131647) and Francesco Corbetta (c. 1615 \u2013 1681), paved the way for the Guitar's popular emergence in the coming centuries.",

The AmigaOne motherboard was to be available in two models, the AmigaOne-1200 and the AmigaOne-4000 as expansion for Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 computers.[5][6] This would probably not have been actually possible. This AmigaOne project was cancelled in the design stage in 2001, mostly due to the inability to find or design a suitable northbridge chip.[7][8] Eyetech, who at this point had invested funds into the project, were forced instead to license the Teron CX board from Mai to form the basis of the new AmigaONE computer range.[9] First fruit of the partnership with Mai, AmigaOne SE, was announced to have connector for an optionally attached Amiga 1200, in order to use the old custom chips of an Amiga for backwards compatibility.[10] However, no such solution was ever introduced.",

    "description": "The Rideal\u2013Walker coefficient, now only of historical interest,[1] is a figure expressing the disinfecting power of any disinfectant. It is the ratio of the dilution of the disinfectant that kills a microorganism to the dilution of phenol that kills the organism in the same time under identical conditions. The Rideal\u2013Walker coefficient determines the phenol coefficient utilizing the method (test) described by English chemists Samuel Rideal (1863\u20131929) and J. T. Ainslie Walker (1868\u20131930).[2]\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary choice of contact time (sterilisation in 7.5 minutes), diluent (distilled water) and test organism (Salmonella typhi, then called Bacillus typhosa) did not reflect the conditions under which disinfectants were used. Because of this, impossibly high values were obtained for disinfectant activity and quoted by disinfectant manufacturers. The method was referred to by distinguished microbiologist Sir Ashley Miles as \"...at best a grossly over-simplified answer to a very difficult problem, and at worst little short of bacteriological prostitution\".[3]\r\n\r\nIt was replaced by a more realistic test devised by Dame Harriette Chick and Sir Charles James Martin,[4] which in turn was replaced by other tests, not reliant on a comparison with phenol, in attempts to assess the effectiveness of particular disinfectants for different purposes.[1]",

He was the brother of William Talbot also a Jacobite commander.[1] Due to the influence of his uncle Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, James II's viceroy in Ireland, James Talbot was given command of a regiment in the Irish Army with the rank of Colonel, although some sources refer to him as a Brigadier.\r\n\r\nHe was killed at the Battle of Aughrim, a major defeat for the Jacobites that cost them many experienced and senior officers. His death in battle meant that his estate was not covered under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick that ended the war, and was liable to forfeiture.[2]",

    "description": "Originally released as a single in 1979, it was not as popular as the group's other contemporary singles such as \"Y.M.C.A.\" and \"In the Navy\". The song's title is attributed to the nineteenth century quote \"Go West, young man\" commonly attributed to Horace Greeley, a rallying cry for the colonization of the American West. Though Victor Willis denies writing the song with a gay theme in mind, \"Go West\" is generally understood as an expression of the 1970s sentiment of San Francisco as a utopia for the Gay Liberation movement.[2]\r\n\r\nBoth the 7\" and 12\" versions of the song were subsequently collected in various greatest hits collections, including a 1997 radio remix which was made in the wake of the success of Pet Shop Boys' 1993 version.\r\n\r\nThe Village People version of the song features in the film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and in the musical of the same name as the three lead characters leave Sydney for Alice Springs (which lies just over 2,000 km north-west of Sydney as the crow flies).",

This technique is commonly used when these differences are needed to run the software on different platforms, or with different versions of required libraries or hardware.\r\n\r\nMany programming languages support conditional compilation. Typically compiler directives define or \"undefine\" certain variables; other directives test these variables and modify compilation accordingly. For example, not using an actual language, the compiler may be set to define \"Macintosh\" and undefine \"PC\", and the code may contain:\r\n\r\n(* System generic code *)\r\nif mac!=Null then\r\n    (* macOS specific code *)\r\nelse is pc!=Null\r\n    (* Windows specific code *)\r\nIn C and some languages with a similar syntax, this is done using an '#ifdef' directive.\r\n\r\nA similar procedure, using the name \"conditional comment\", is used by Microsoft Internet Explorer from version 5 to 9 to interpret HTML code. There is also a similar proprietary mechanism for adding conditional comments within JScript, known as conditional compilation.[1]",

    "description": "\"Shake It Off\" is a song performed by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey, taken from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). It was written and produced by Carey along with Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Johnt\u00e1 Austin. The song was initially solicited to radio on July 12, 2005 by Island and Mercury Records as the album's third single in the United States, while \"Get Your Number\" served as the album's third single elsewhere. Described by Dupri as \"ghetto,\" the track is a R&B song that makes use of pop and hip hop influences and a simple, sparse production. Lyrically, the song follows Carey as she moves on from her relationship with an unfaithful lover, packing her things and breaking up with him over an answering machine.",
